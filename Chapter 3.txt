3.1 — When a Picture Flips, the Meaning Flips
In the last chapter, we drew the simplest picture in physics:
- a horizontal axis T
- a vertical axis t
- two spaceships
- two different angles
That picture already contains relativity.
But it also contains something deeper — something almost nobody notices the first time they see it:
If you rotate the entire picture, the physics stays the same,
but the interpretation changes.
This is the inversion.
It is the conceptual move that unlocks the rest of the theory.

3.2 — The Universe as a Rotated Frame
Imagine taking the entire t–T graph and rotating it slightly.
Nothing physical changes:
- the ships still move
- their angles still differ
- their internal times still flow
- their relative motion is unchanged
But the meaning of the picture changes.
In one orientation, the ships look like they’re moving through a static background.
In another, the background looks like it’s stretching.
In another, the ships look like they’re slowing down.
In another, they look like they’re speeding up.
Same geometry.
Different interpretation.
This is the key insight:
Cosmology is a choice of frame.
And the frame we’ve been using might be rotated the wrong way.


3.3 — The Standard Interpretation: Expansion
In the standard cosmological frame:
- distant galaxies appear redshifted
- the redshift increases with distance
- the simplest explanation is expansion
- the expansion rate appears to change over time
- the Hubble constant depends on how you measure it
This interpretation works —
but only if you add:
- inflation
- dark energy
- tuning parameters
- early structure formation “surprises”
- galaxy age anomalies
- and a handful of unexplained tensions
It’s a good map.
But it’s a map with patches.

3.4 — The Rotational Interpretation: Tempo Differences
Now rotate the frame.
In this new orientation:
- redshift is not caused by expansion
- redshift is caused by Tempo differences
- distant objects have different rotational angles
- their internal time flows differently
- light accumulates the difference as it travels
- the universe looks “older” at large distances because Tempo changes with depth
Same observations.
Different explanation.
This is the inversion:
What looks like expansion in one frame
looks like Tempo geometry in another.

And the Tempo interpretation:
- removes the Hubble tension
- removes the need for inflation
- removes the need for dark energy
- explains early galaxy formation
- explains age anomalies
- explains smooth scaling
- explains redshift without stretching space
All by rotating the picture.

3.5 — Why the Inversion Works
The inversion works because relativity is fundamentally geometric.
If time dilation is rotation,
and energy is rotation,
and motion is rotation,
then cosmology — the large‑scale behaviour of time and energy — must also be rotation.
The universe is not expanding.
It is rotating in the t–T plane.
And when you rotate the frame:
- the same worldlines
- the same light paths
- the same observations
…produce a different story.
A simpler story.
A story without patches.

3.6 — A Universe That Looks the Same, But Means Something Else
This is the moment where the reader should feel the ground shift:
- The universe they thought was expanding
- might not be expanding at all
- The redshift they thought was stretching
- might be geometric
- The age they thought was inconsistent
- might be perfectly consistent
- The “tensions” they thought were problems
- might be artefacts of the wrong frame
This is not a rejection of physics.
It is a reinterpretation of physics.
A rotation of the map.

3.7 — What Comes Next
In the next chapter, we begin the transition from intuition to structure.
We introduce:
- Tempo formally
- the idea of \tau =\frac{dt}{dT}
- the geometry of rotational frames
- the first mathematical hints of the master equation
- the role of Q as the depth dimension behind the rotation
