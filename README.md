Rotational Relativity: The Q‑Axis, Tempo, and Infinite Subjective Time
A conceptual overview
1. The Core Idea
Rotational Relativity proposes that the universe evolves along a hidden geometric axis — the Q‑axis — representing cosmic unfolding. Motion (φ) and cosmic evolution (θ) are rotations in different planes of a unified 4‑axis structure.
The key measurable quantity is Tempo:
T=\cos \phi \cdot \cos \theta 
Tempo is the local rate at which processes unfold.
It is what clocks measure, what chemistry runs on, and what “time” feels like from the inside.
- φ: rotation into the I‑axis (special relativity)
- θ: rotation into the Q‑axis (cosmic evolution)
This single expression unifies SR time dilation and cosmological time dilation into one geometric object.

2. The Corrected Geometry
A crucial insight:
Tempo is maximal at the qE origin (Q = 0), not zero.
At Q = 0:
- θ = 0
- φ = 0
- Tempo = 1 (maximum)
This matches the early universe:
- hot
- dense
- fast
- explosively dynamic
As Q increases:
- θ increases
- Tempo decreases
- the universe slows
- structure formation slows
- expansion enters the “freezeout” regime
As Q → ∞:
- θ → 90°
- Tempo → 0
- the universe approaches a horizon
- physical processes freeze
But — and this is the breakthrough — Tempo approaches zero asymptotically, just like velocity approaches c in SR.

3. The Tempo Curve
Using a simple and natural model:
\theta (Q)=\arctan (kQ)
Tempo becomes:
T(Q)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(kQ)^2}}
This curve:
- starts at 1
- falls smoothly
- approaches 0 only at infinite Q
- never hits zero in finite cosmic evolution
This is the cosmological analogue of the SR limit.

4. The Breakthrough: Infinite Subjective Time
Subjective time is the integral of Tempo:
d\tau =T(Q)\, dQ
Total subjective time from the qE origin to any finite Q is:
\tau (Q)=\int _0^QT(Q')\, dQ'
With the arctan model:
\tau (Q)=\frac{1}{k}\sinh ^{-1}(kQ)
And as Q → ∞:
\tau _{\mathrm{total}}=\frac{1}{k}\sinh ^{-1}(\infty )=\infty 
This is the key result:
The universe can freeze physically (Tempo → 0)
while still containing infinite subjective time for any observer.

Everything slows together.
No one ever feels the slowdown.
No one ever reaches the horizon.
Time never “ends” — it just stretches.
This is the cosmological analogue of the SR asymptote:
- A rocket approaches c forever
- The universe approaches freezeout forever
- Both require infinite proper time to reach the limit
Same geometry.
Different plane.

5. Why This Matters
This framework offers:
A unified geometric picture
SR and cosmology become rotations in different planes of the same 4‑axis structure.
A new interpretation of cosmic acceleration
Acceleration is not “mysterious dark energy” — it is the curvature of θ(Q) as Tempo falls.
A new understanding of cosmic fate
Heat death is not the end of time.
It is the end of Tempo.
Subjective time continues indefinitely.
A new way to think about time itself
Time is not a universal flow.
It is a local projection of a deeper rotation.

6. What This Repository Contains
This project develops:
- the Q‑axis geometry
- the Tempo formalism
- the unified φ/θ rotation structure
- the cosmological mapping
- the SR/Q asymptote symmetry
- the implications for cosmic evolution and subjective experience
Future work will include:
- mapping Q to observational cosmology
- deriving θ(Q) from H(z)
- placing Q_now
- computing Tempo_now
- exploring alternative θ(Q) models
- visual diagrams and animations

7. Why You Should Care
If you’re a physicist, cosmologist, or theorist:
- This framework unifies SR and cosmology in a way GR never quite managed.
- It offers a new geometric interpretation of cosmic acceleration.
- It predicts infinite subjective time — a falsifiable, structural claim.
- It reframes the meaning of horizons, time dilation, and cosmic fate.
If you’re a philosopher or curious thinker:
- It changes what “the end of the universe” means.
- It changes what “time” means.
- It changes what “experience” means.
If you’re just here for the ride:
- It’s a beautiful idea.
- And it might be true.
