# Rotational Relativity
Rotational Relativity
Rotational Relativity is an evolving theoretical framework exploring how rotational dynamics, imaginary dimensions, and tempo ( dt/dT ) reshape our understanding of Special Relativity, General Relativity, redshift, and cosmogenic structure.
This repository contains the working drafts and supporting documents for the project. Each part is being refined iteratively, with diagrams, notation, and explanatory scaffolding added over time.

🧭 Purpose of This Repository
This project aims to:
- Build a coherent, mathematically anchored reinterpretation of relativity using rotational geometry
- Provide a unified explanation for redshift, time dilation, and gravitational effects
- Explore cosmogenic implications of a rotational spacetime
- Document the iterative development of the theory through working drafts
- Provide a public, timestamped record of the research process

📄 Documents
The primary documents are available in this repository as .docx files:
- Part 1 — RSR
- Part 2 — RGR
- Part 3 — Redshift
- Part 4 — Cosmogeny
These files will be updated as the theory matures.

🧩 Future Additions
Planned expansions include:
- A glossary of symbols and conventions
- Diagram sets with consistent axis notation
- A mind‑map linking Q‑dimension, tempo, photon ribbon geometry, and cosmogenic structure
- A correction index for notation and diagram updates
- A GitHub Pages site presenting the theory in a structured, navigable format

🛰️ About the Project
